#+title: Mathematical Proofs

a proof is an argument (verification) of a mathematical statement (theorem)
Lemma - small/helping theorem
Corollary - a direct result of a theorem
Conjecture - posed to be true but not proven

How?
Definitions, Axioms, Logic

*What does it look like?*
Axiom -> logical progression -> theorem

Assumptions and Conclusions are given
What ari re proving
simething equals something, something has a quality

Theorem: Root of 2 is irrational
Defition of a ratioanl/irrational number
Def: An irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed in thi form m/n, where m and n are integers
- Suppose root of 2 ir ratioanl
- so m and n are integers
- trying to prove the opposite and finding a logical contradiction disproves it?
