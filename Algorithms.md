Idea : I could make a sort of tattoo 
That like a mental palace I have Anchor points that let me remember stuff and help 

- Algorithms 
- ðŸ’«pythonðŸ’«
- what is an algorithm? Set of steps or instructions for completing a task
- so a recipe is also an algorithm
- any code is an algorithm (okay most presumably)
- solving mazes = constructing algorithms
- there are some better ways to solve a maze so we pick the best one and that's kinda what this is about 
- we also need to properly see the problem first 
- so our goal is that when we look at a problem we're able to take it apart and see what algorithm we need
- note: CS is so fascinating, it's like applied math lmao. All of the math we do rn is looking at a problem ajd choosing what algorithm you need to solve it (and memorizing the algorithm). While math is about studying the problem itself, studying algorithms would be about the meta level, so kinda like studying the solution. Very cool.
