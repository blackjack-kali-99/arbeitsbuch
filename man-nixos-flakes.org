#+title: Manual NixOS Flakes
*  what are nix flakes?
- self-contained units
- have *inputs* - dependencies
- and *outputs* - packages, build instructions, nix funtions for use in other flakes
 = reproducibility bc they ccan only depend on their inputs and pin the exact versions of those inputs to a lockfile

* get unstable nix up and running (? is this necessary?)

* nixlang stuff

* writing flakes
- Flake = a directory that contains a flake.nix file
  - which must include:
    - outputs
  - optionally can include:
    - inputs
    - description

* outputs
= funtion that takes an attribute set of inputs
- always at least one output: self

{
 inputs = {
   nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs";
   };
 outputs = { self, nixpkgs }: {};
}
