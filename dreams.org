- especially for highly logical working people 
- our brain has a lot of info we don't know about or don't have access to 
- intuition may be information that is significant but we don't know how to make sense of (scrambled)
- nightmares are a significant part of PTSD
- we don/t dream of things we don't know about, so logically it has to be our brain making scrambled eggs of things we already perceived 


- symbols in the dream are subjectively related to YOU 
- 

* dream journal 
- open up to dreams before (talk to your brain)
- keep a dream journal 
- write down as many details as you can
focus on emotions - the emotions in dreams are real 
where do I feel tho emotions in the real world 

* symbols in the dream?
- what do they symbolize to me? 
- there may not be a universal significance to the symbols

** Test
my dreams atm are related to atomic war a lot
last night i was in a dream where i had to do something (i think in a team but i felt no emotional connection to the team, it wasn't comforting) where either we die or everyone dies (world gets destroyed)
emotions 
usually still do a lot of logical planning in my dreams, it may even be a way for it to train logic we don't usually train fos because it would be too imotionally demanding 
i was terrified 
i didn't want for whatever was happening to happen but it seemed inevitable 
i was trapped 
it was definitely some kind of mission but it held no honor
some kind of apocalypse 
martyrdom

what does it mean?

martyrdom is something i do rn too, in helping others even tho i feel like i am unable to 
i feel like an asshole cause i don't really care about them, but if i did it would destroy me and then i couldn't help them anymore. I have the constant push to appear logical and pure to others so they would feel like i am worth protecting, but deep down i know there is no way they could protect me, and by avoiding asking for help or protection i am just avoiding realizing that i am helpless and they need just as much help as me. 
cause if i assumed they can't help me i would also cease to go to them for help and lose them cause helping someone or needing help is probably the major way i even relate or interact at all. 
the impeding doom is a real threat, not much symbolism there, i am litterally scared of doom
i am also litterally scared of apocalypse, but also feel like et es already here (feeling alone, abandoned, disconnected, but there is still hope left for that changing, and if there was an actual apocalypse there would just not be hope.)
( the brain can't produce things it doesnt know)
the invitable martyrdom may also be related to my "mission" (or nirjas) cause it would have to be a very bitter price to pay to keep us all alive 




i woke up and texted my parent
