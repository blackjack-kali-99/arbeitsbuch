- especially for highly logical working people 
- our brain has a lot of info we don't know about or don't have access to 
- intuition may be information that is significant but we don't know how to make sense of (scrambled)
- nightmares are a significant part of PTSD
- we don/t dream of things we don't know about, so logically it has to be our brain making scrambled eggs of things we already perceived 


- symbols in the dream are subjectively related to YOU 
- 

* dream journal 
- open up to dreams before (talk to your brain)
- keep a dream journal 
- write down as many details as you can
focus on emotions - the emotions in dreams are real 
where do I feel tho emotions in the real world 

* symbols in the dream?
- what do they symbolize to me? 
- there may not be a universal significance to the symbols
