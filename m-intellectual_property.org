Q:
Second Thought - Why We Should Get Rid Of Intellectual Property - Nov 18 2022
Bias: Second Thought is a multi million follower socialist YouTube guy (us-american)
My own Bias: I personally like the guy and agree with him ideologically so I am very much positively biased. 


* thesis : there is no reason for intellectual property to exist
- example to prove the thesis: Insulin
  - Insulin only costs like 10$ to make a vial but is sold for way more because the patent is owned by 3 corperations.
  - formula for insulin is like 100 years old ant those companies dont really own them
  - Covid Vaccines are the same
  - more deaths in poorir countries

- innovation?
- profit needs scarcity - in the case where we can actually produce all the shit we need they need to create (port-scarcity - we technically have the resources to feed, house, etc the world several times over and technological advancement does only improve that(where is that study)) a false scarcity has to be created to keep people needing things ( line go up )
  - counter: according to lacan we are constantly desiring something and are even attracted to desiring (i need to find my notes on that and where its described)
- on the question of "is intellectual property needed for innovation"
  the argument: people
