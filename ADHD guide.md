# Models of Motivation 
What is Motivation 
Motivation is an emergent Property - it emerges out of other factors
there is no sanskrit word for motivation , it arises out of a lot of different factors 
take a personalized approach 
diagnosis first 

1. Intent 
- we can have all kinda goals, but a lot of the time we don't really care about them - they are "should"s that are more externally motivated. we need to figure out why we even do it and discard goals that are not genuine
2. Resistance 
- emotional blockages
- sense of identity can hold us back 
3. Action 
- setting goals in a way that will make it easier 

# Hunters vs Farmers
- Variablity within Population also applies to attention 
- Farmers - creatures of habit, routines
- Hunters - highly variable attention, bored easily 
- ADHD has a strong genetic component
- populations with high percentages of hunters and gatherers also have high ADHD prerelevance 
- is a bit more complicated tho, loke 35.000 years ago we started negatively for ADHD genes
- ADHD people struggle in some environments but thrive in others - f.e. student-teacher ratio
- ADHD can also do hyperfocus

==What have you noticed about the relationship between routine and attention ? 
 In what ways does routine help your attention? 
 In what ways does it make it difficult?== 

Routine helps my attention when it structures my day so i know what to do when. I struggle to sort what I need to do in what order and then getting myself up to start doing it. For example in school I am basically forced to focus on the thing and do work in a certain order. Instructions are usually clear so it is confined what i do and i don't need to worry about if how i am doing it is the ideal way to do it, cause i don't get a choice. There's also a clear feedback and external consequence system. I can't just go back to bed. 
When I have free time I have absolutely no routine. What I can do and did is that i build a routine according to other people. Either beause i wanted to spend time with them or because i wanted to avoid them. This also works. I also didn't have to feel bad about doing something for reasons of "i should be doing this other thing". It basically provides order to my chaos. 
What I don't like is that external routine necessarily means interruptions and disrupts my focus. So I can't get into my flow state because I have to switch my attention from one thing to the next withiut getting any choice. I also can only do 20% of the stuff i'd want to do because school isn't exactly adjusted for the individual. I can't skip things I already know or work in my own speed. So any ideal routine would necessarly have to be a bit more self-directed, but i can't really do it on my own cause then i'm simply gonna ignore the routine. 

==think about a time where you were hyperfocused. What factors helped create that state of mind.==
- no loud uncontrollable noises or people around me (people i am used to is okay, groups of people is not. my nervous system has to be okay with them or im just gonna be anxious.)
- it was largely self-directed in terms of how i did it but it had a clear goal of what i wanted it to be / expectations were clear
- i was comfortable in the environment (temperature, noise, chair wasn't a bitch, nobody was coming to talk to me randomly)
- comfortable in my own skin 
- wasn't having a mental breakdown (nothing too bad was happening, OR i was hyperfocusing to surpress that, my 5h reading w/o interruptions were def that kind)
- i had nowhere else to be and nobody was expecting much more of me than existing 
- there was a slight but not overwhelming external pressure (okay overwhelming works too short-term, think of "it is currently 2am on a schoolnight and i have to re-install my bootloader or my computer is done)

==think about a time where it was difficult to focus on the task you wanted to do. What triggers or distractions got in the way?==
- I didn't know what task i should do first cause there were 30 and none of them were really important but all were kinda needing to get done
- i didn't break the task up correctly
- something unexpected happened and then my day wasn't going like i was expecting it to go and my brain just kinda went "nope"
- mostly doing stuff after school
- doing stuff when i am not sure what the goal is or why i am even supposed to do it
- someone placed the demand on me and my brain said "well now i am not doing it"
- *I* placed the demand on myself and my brain also said *well now i aint doing it*
- it was something i didn't have any joy in 
- i was obsessing over the meta-layer
- someone was watching me and uhhhhh nope 
- i was uncomfortabli on the environment (too many people, having to constantly check on something, working without a desk)
- i was super scared to fail or had to keep up an appearance i didnt care about 
- it was boring work (arithmetic in 3rd grade) 
- it was a competition (fuck those)

==How can you structure your life to maximize your own attentional fingerprint? What ways can you schedule things so that it is easy to focus? How can you reduce the triggers
