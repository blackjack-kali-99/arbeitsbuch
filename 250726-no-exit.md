# No Exit - Jean Paul Satre 

Backround
I've rececntly come to take an interest in existentialism and absurdism. Partly because I have actual diagnosed depression (for almost a decade now)
and i've not allowed myself to study nihilism because i didn't want to make it worse by letting it gain intellectual ground. 
partly because the question of purpose and anything being worth anything and life itself is still worth engaging with. 

either way I've come to own (by perfectly legal means, look elsewhere) a play called No Exit by Jean Paul Satre that seems to belong to a textbook or so.
They include some reflection questions here and there and I figured it'd be fun to answer them.
They are in english so this document is also in english. I don't bother translating, the book is in english too, i usually prefer to reatd in the original languge but i don't speak french well enough (or at all beyond the simplest)

- can the mind be in hell in a beautiful place? 
if the beautiful place is like described, always the same and inescapeable, then yes, there is nothing stopping it from being hell. Humans need stimulation, they will eventually shut down and become unresponsive if there is nothing stimulating them. Even if it is beautiful. 
- is there a way to find peace in a hellish physical environment? 
depending on how you define "peace"- 
the human brain has several survival mechanisms in place. If a pain signal is constant and severe then it can essentially tune down the volume on it and develope a tolerance. Or otherwise dissociate from the experience. I think in case of being locked up the brain can stimulate itself by creating psychosis. But then this hasn't been tested how it would run over centuries. I think someone who has a rich innerworld would find stimulation there for a bit, i don't know how far it can help tho. 
You can certainly be *numb* to a hellish physical environment. Humans can get used to pretty much anything. 
Then there's the question of actual peace. And i think buddhism would say that you can attain liberation / enlightment regardlee of your environment, and that may even be useful. If there is no artificial joy or pleasure keeping you stuck in attachment then you could probably even say it'd be easier to detach (note that detachment isn't apathy as described earlier) and be at peace eventually. 
- enter satre's room more fully and imagine what it would be like to live there, night and day
it'd suck not gonna lie there's not much more to say about it. Complete isolation from anyone except 2 people that basically torture you with the certainty of never getting out and having no contact to anyone, no emotional attachments etc, but you still have your ego etc, yea no i'd take the torture chamber at least they might be more creative there.  

2. 
- how does satre create a sense of place trough dialogue? 
he lets the characters mention and explain the place instead of informing about every detail in huge walls of descriptive monologue. 
he also leaves a good chunk of room for the readers imagination, but calls attention to details like the toothbrush that serve as a detail giving more insight and opining opportunity for more questions. 
- can you imagine what it would feel like to stay awake all the time with the lights on with no hope of leaving a specific place ?
aren't we? exept if you count REM sleep, but still. i mean you never leave your own head and can't exactly hope to. still if you'd develope some sort of wish to leave your own mind you'll also be perceived as sick (suicidal), so by societies perception, you're not supposed to want to leave. But then, arguably you have more control over your mind (if you were to see it as a room). You can change the interior around. I suppose. Or you could hope to. All in all I think it'd be the perfect hell, and you can't even hope for death. Wouldn't you become super overstimulated? You also can't be alone aparently. Well, I know what it is like to live on a 3x3m space with someone you don't even know that well for indefinite amount of time (bonus points for opposite gender) and i can say that'd be one of the biggest issues since you're permanently subconciously having to evaluate how each of your actions is *read* - even if you think you're not, you have a thing in your mind that makes sure you don't piss yourself in public, so there's a part of you for sure adjusting your every acion towards who you're with. For that to happen it will have to constantly self-objectify and extrapolate reactions. It's a huge calculation, so energy drain. So i'd say you will need some kind of rest even if you dont physically need to sleep.
- how does GARCIN react to this hell 
he's not vibing but pretending to not mind? idk to be honest they seem a bit calm to me fo the situation 
- how could you twist your daily activities aroound so that evisyday habits become hell ?
if i were to never leave my room again i'd be in hell. if i had no life left to live and knew that i wont meet anyone anymore i'd be in hell. if i knew that i will never find a thing i love anymore i'd be in hell. if my life was simply inescapeable i'd be in hell. also if i couldn't die. I mean I'd love to have a bit more time to learn more  stuff and get to know the world and the people i love better but it has to have an end or we'd all go insane. Death is scary because we know absolutely nothing but living forever would drive us all insane. I had nightmares about that as a child. Lets say: infinity is hell.
- is there a pattern of circumstances that reinforces the experience of hell? 
No ability to escape, no agency in what happens to you, no control over what happens, separation from "life" or "earth", immortality (can't die twice), some sort of distress or pain, lastly, that it's eternal and always the same and portrayed as a just punishment for something
